## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to 
**coming soon**.

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Architecture

### Encryption
- All files are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage
- Encryption keys are derived using PBKDF2 with 310,000 iterations
- Transport layer security with TLS 1.3
- JWT tokens for API authentication

### Data Protection
- Zero-knowledge architecture where possible
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Secure deletion of expired files

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Session timeouts and automatic logout
- Audit logging for all security-sensitive operations

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Institutions
1. Use strong, unique passwords for admin accounts
2. Enable two-factor authentication where available
3. Regularly review access logs and user permissions
4. Keep the system updated with the latest security patches
5. Conduct regular security training for users

### For Developers
1. Never hardcode secrets or API keys
2. Use environment variables for configuration
3. Regularly update dependencies
4. Follow secure coding practices
5. Conduct code reviews for security issues

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

Our security team will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report and strive to send you regular updates about our progress. If you're contributing a fix, we'll coordinate with you on the release timing.

### Our Process
1. **Confirmation**: We confirm the vulnerability and determine affected versions
2. **Fix Development**: We develop a fix in a private repository
3. **Testing**: We thoroughly test the fix
4. **Release**: We release the fix in a new version
5. **Disclosure**: We publish a security advisory on GitHub

We credit discoverers of vulnerabilities in our release notes and security advisories, unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

## Security Updates

Subscribe to security announcements by watching releases on this repository. We will tag security updates with `[SECURITY]` in the release notes.

## Bug Bounty Program

We do not currently have a bug bounty program. However, we greatly appreciate security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities and may offer recognition in our release notes.

## Third-Party Dependencies

We regularly monitor our dependencies for security vulnerabilities using:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Snyk vulnerability scanning
- Dependabot automated updates
